# CVE Severity Score

CVE is assigned a severity score according to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):
- range from 0-10
- final score includes different factors, such as the vulnerability's impact, ease of exploitability, and vulnerable target distribution

A CVSS score is also represented as a string, which contains the values used to derive the score. 

For example, examine a CVSS 9.0 (critical severity) vulnerability, wherein a buffer overflow can be exploited in a web application to cause a crash. 

The CVSS string corresponding to the vuln, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C, means the following: 
- Access Vector (AV) - Netork (N): The vuln may be exploited from any network that can access the target system
- Access Complexity (AC) — Low (L): Accessing the vulnerability is not complex.
- Authentication (Au) — None (N): The attacker is not required to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- Confidentiality (C) — Partial (P): The attacker can access some additional files and data on the system as a result of exploiting the vulnerability.
- Integrity (I) — Partial (P): The attacker is able to alter some files or data on the system.
- Availability (A) — Complete (C): The attacker is able to cause the system to become completely unavailable as a result of exploiting the vulnerability.

Severity      	Base Score Range
None	            0.0
Low	                0.1-3.9
Medium	            4.0-6.9
High	            7.0-8.9
Critical	        9.0-10.0
